### Updated June 28, 2020

Starting July 5, the sequence of services will be as follows: at 9am, we will meet for the sermon and Lord's Supper at the building. This will stream on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0kUKcP_9v4_WfhyDAN5DOg) as well. Bible class will run from 10:30am to 11:15am on Zoom. Hopefully this will give more people the opportunity to gather in person and also participate in Bible class.

If you have symptoms, *please stay home.*

Pursuant to the governor’s revised executive orders, based on CDC guidelines, THESE CONDITIONS APPLY:

1. All those who attend must be masked.
2. As you enter, individually-wrapped communion supplies will be available, as will hand sanitizer and a basket to leave your contribution.
3. Seating will be socially-distanced, that is, every other pew, and each individual at least 6 feet apart (except for family members living together).

We ask that each one wear their masks except for partaking of the Lord’s supper. Hymns, probably the activity with the most potential to spread viruses, will be limited to the Lord’s Supper and end of the service.

Again, if you have any symptoms, you should stay home. Those in high-risk groups who do not feel safe assembling at this time should not feel pressured to attend.

REMINDER: If you enter the building after 9am, you will be entering during the livestream. *Please enter quietly.*

Thank you for your cooperation!
