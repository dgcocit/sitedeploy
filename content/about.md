### What To Expect
We desire to worship God in spirit and in truth (John 4:24). It is our desire to speak the truth of God in its entirety. As the apostle Peter said in 1 Peter 4:11, "If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God."

### Singing
Just like the first century Christians we read about in the Bible, we will sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs (Eph 5:19).

### Praying
Time will be spent petitioning our Heavenly Father in prayer (Acts 2:42).

### The Lord's Supper
On the first day of the week we will partake of the Lord's Supper, as Jesus instructed (1 Cor 11:23-29).

### Giving
We, as members, will give to God out of our earnings (1 Cor 16:1-2). Visitors are never asked to give. You may if you would like to, but it is never expected of our visitors.

### Preaching And Teaching
There will be gospel preaching (Acts 20:7), which is designed to convict and encourage (2 Tim 4:2). Our sermons strive to apply the Bible to everyday living.

We encourage you to ask questions after the worship service or during the Bible studies. We come together to learn and do God's will and hope that you will come to learn with us. We hope to see you soon!
