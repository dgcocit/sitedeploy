Religious people like to present themselves in a way they hope to be seen. Most often it is in a way that they see themselves. They stand before us showing a resolute dedicated individual, unwavering in support of the Gospel. While to others their stand for gospel teaching is not so firm and sometimes seems to be against what the Bible even stands for.

For sure each Lord’s Day the image of correctness is seen by all when the congregation is assembled, provided for all to see. Songs, prayers, giving, reading the Bible, are all done in line with what the image wants you to see.

Incongruities of the image may appear when the assembly is dismissed and the sun rises and a different group of people are to be confronted. A new image sometimes appears, one not so religious nor prayerful. One that joins in the careless morality of topical discussions regarding TV shows, or murderous movies with overt sexual agenda and connotations, or even perversions of decency that would have caused a moral outrage the day before.

The image carried to the congregation sometimes is not the same as the weekday image. What is done creates the image. The Sunday image carries a “woe” with it that is mentioned in the Bible. Matthew 23:27-28 cries out this woe to hypocrites who show one face here and another there. "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.” NKJV

Our image is important and if it is carelessly presented may direct all thoughts of your conduct to be considered the same. Careless dress and language would present a person of careless morals. “Sloppy is that sloppy does” is an adage that still has its sting of truth to it. A clean inside is hard to see if the outside is so carelessly presented. We each see ourselves differently because we are seeing a reflection of who we think we are. Our actions define our image and James 1:23-24 tells that we should always be doing what the Word of God shows us to do.
