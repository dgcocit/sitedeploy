Not feeling well can be difficult to deal with no matter how old you are. And although feeling ill our daily decisions continue regardless of our health condition. Everyday time tables tick-tock on while one deals with alternating feeling better soon and being so sick you think no one will notice if schedules are missed.

However, sickness doesn’t care about your schedules and it seems to know when to flare up and make you feel a little worse whenever you even think about your responsibilities. Staying healthy involves getting back to health once you have been visited with infection and suffering.

The Bible deals with sickness in both the physical and spiritual sense. Jesus came to Peter’s house and saw that “Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever. Jesus touched her hand and helped her up and the fever left her. That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. The whole town gathered at the door, and Jesus healed many who had various diseases.” (Mk. 1:30-34)

In the normal trials of life, it’s not the healthy that need a doctor but the sick. Jesus said that His place was with the sinners as a doctor is with the sick in Matthew 9:12. If someone is perfectly healthy, they would have no need of a physician.

In the physical sense the brother of Mary and Martha, Lazarus, was sick and died. His physical death was to be utilized for God’s glory, so that God’s Son may be glorified through it (Jn. 11:4). Lazarus’ death created an opportunity to cause greater faith.

Those mentioned as sick in James 5 can refer both to the spiritual and physically ill and they should call for the elders who will give him spiritual medicine for his illness and pray for him. Fervent prayer avails much.
