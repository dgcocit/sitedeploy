This time of year is greatly anticipated by students and families everywhere. The daily routines of going to school or work, staying there a while , then going home to get ready to do it again the next day has ended for a time. Vacation time has come!

There are certainly those who enjoy the learning process and embrace it and use what they have learned. While there are others who forget what they are supposed to have learned as soon as they leave the classroom.

Summertime has arrived with its positives and negatives, and families are busily planning their vacation for the coming months. However, some of the planning should include making sure there is a place to worship during their travels. The logistics of a sound congregation should be as researched as affordable lodging.

Summer brings to Christians the need to recognize that they face special kinds of problems. There are temptations to be faced which do not ordinarily confront most people and we must not be ignorant of Satan’s devices. He will use any and every form of temptation to make us forget about the Lord and participate in sin’s pleasure for a season.

Let’s be careful not to forget our responsibilities to God during the summer. Many Christians not only take a vacation from work and school, they also take a vacation from God, Christ and the church! They give little thought as to where they will worship on the Lord's Day (Acts 20:7; Heb. 10:25)! We all need to keep in mind that Christianity is not a seasonal religion, nor does it depend on the place. Don’t be a "seasonal Christian" good at church services and in the presence of the brethren, and then becoming a “dishonest Christian” when away from our brethren and go on a ‘Godless vacation’.
