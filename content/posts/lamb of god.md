Sacrifices involving lambs began with Abel in the lamb book of Genesis. Blood shed by the firstlings of the flock (Gen. 4:4) was “a more acceptable offering” to ofgod God (Heb. 11:4) than an offering of plants. This pattern is repeated throughout the Old Testament emphasizing many important lessons.

Lambs themselves represent the renewal and replenishing of the flocks. They are valuable for their meat is tender and used for special occasions. Not for casual consumption. Much consideration would be given before killing the lambs for guests and dignitaries.

The importance in using sacrificial lambs is seen in the many offerings and feasts designated in the Law of Moses. Each day was to begin and end with a lamb sacrifice in the continual burnt offerings (Exo. 29:28-42). A busy schedule of slaying lambs was kept on the 1st day of the month, the feast of Weeks, the feast of Trumpets, and the feast of Trumpets and Tabernacles. (See Numbers chapters 28 and 29).

The deliverance of God’s people from the slavery of Egypt came with a slaying of a lamb and the sprinkling of its blood on their doors. The Passover lamb celebrated annually came to be synonymous with a sacrifice. The Lamb of God is a title for Jesus that appears when John the Baptist sees Jesus and says, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world." (John 1:29) To the Jews the reference to a lamb could mean only sacrifice.

Isaiah the Prophet told of the Messiah that was to be brought as a lamb to the slaughter (Isa 53:7) and was to suffer for His people (53:5). Paul wrote of Jesus as Christ our Passover being sacrificed for us (1 Cor. 5:7) and Peter tells that we were redeemed by the “precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb...” (1 Peter 1:19). To see Jesus as the sinless lamb of God is to put His sacrifice into perspective.
