Remembering things is often difficult. Our memory system is weak. Even though some may claim that
they may have a photographic memory time is not their friend. Trying to remember specifics can be challenging. Names and dates sometimes need repetition to recall them properly. God has recognized man's need for such reminders.

Deeds and actions done years ago fade from memory quickly because they are so seldom brought to mind. Acts of bravery, kindness and generosity are fresh but for a short while. But they too become mere vacant bytes on the C Drive of the beneficiaries of passing generations.

The sacrifices of warriors to the benefit of others is soon forgotten without a recurring reminder. The giving of one’s life becomes just a line in the seldom read history book unless it’s value is refreshed periodically.

God’s Son and what He has given to mankind is also subject to the lack of memory space. The magnitude of the gift of the life of Christ, once for all, needs a memorial that is worthy and that is frequent. One not left on the shelf until an annual date rolls around or recalled at a convenient time.

The memorial of the sacrifice of Jesus for the remission of our sins is to be observed as God has willed; on the first day of the week, every week (1 Cor. 16:1-2). Our memorial day of the love shown for us is to be purposefully kept ever before us.

Since our ability to remember is not very strong a fitting memorial to Jesus is just what He said to do and is described in Luke 22:17-20. Christians have such a memorial day, called Sunday, referred to unpretentiously as "the first day of the week" (Lk. 24:1; Acts 20:7) keeping believers in memory of the most marvelous sacrifice ever made for mortal man.
