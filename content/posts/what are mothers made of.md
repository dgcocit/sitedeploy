There used to be a saying about what little boys and little girls are made of. The boys were said to
be made of “snips and snails and puppy dog tails” - while little girls were made of “sugar and spice and everything nice, and there always seemed to be a bit of truth to those sayings.

Today, the second Sunday in May, designated as Mother’s Day, the focus is on what Mothers would be made of. This is a harder question than it sounds. What would the ingredients be to make up such a wonderful person.

In researching this topic I read where “a five year old girl once said “God makes mothers out of clouds and angel hair and everything nice in the world... and one dab of mean.” While a six year old boy thought that they might be made of “string and duct tape and other stuff”.” A child’s view of their mom probably doesn't reflect very much depth as to what they really go through being a mother and raising children.

How much patience, tolerance, worry, giving, hoping, praying and loving could you put together to make a mom? How much feeding, caring, getting you ready for school and worship and visiting relatives and watching out for dangers would be enough to say one is complete and ready for the job?

Reflecting on how much a mother gives for their children a deep and abiding love is seen. The special place in our hearts for our mothers is never replaced, as children have the hearts of their mothers forever.

Proverbs 31 is often a chapter studied in “ladies classes” telling of a virtuous woman and a good mother. It is a must reading, however, for all who would care for their mothers and the mother of their children. It is God’s powerful words in depicting the depth of a mother’s concern for her household and her family.
