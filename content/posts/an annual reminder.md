There is a time to remember, reflect and recognize where you’ve been and where you are headed. Married people do this all the time on their anniversary. This is not like a birthday where it’s a celebration of another year passing by – another year older and deeper in debt. There is not much reflection on birthdays until maybe later on in life.

Remembering your wedding day however, is remembering the day God joined you together. (Matt. 19:6; Rom. 7:2). A time when vows are made - when solemn promises are made before God and everyone that was invited to witness the event (“the LORD is acting as the witness between you and the wife of your youth,” Mal 2:14).

Weddings are a day of leaving and cleaving (“a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.” Gen 2:24). New lives are beginning as one where there was two. A point in time to be noted and built upon. Importance is placed on not forgetting what was done that day by celebrating it—to remember it is a part of daily life.

Love, loyalty and life together with a common goal requires dedication, understanding and compromises to work with each other as a family. Not only physically but also as a spiritual family.

In the Old Testament many reminders were woven into daily activities to the Israelites to keep God ever before them.

Forgetting is too easy. Dilution of value comes quickly when events are ignored and put aside as just another day. Remembering is teaching not only yourself to keep vows intact but also others who observe your conduct and attention to how faithful you are to what you said you would do. The next generation of marriages will have its own problems to deal with and can be made easier to handle with the proper example to follow.
