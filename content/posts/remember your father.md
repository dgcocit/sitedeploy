As the tender years quickly pass by don’t fail to tell your father of your love for him. He loves to hear your dreams and cares and if you ask him why it may bring tears to your eyes. Fathers’ hearts are such that they want their children to be happy and safe from all the traps and snares of the world that seem so evil.

It takes but casual conversation to make images of his children flash before him. Cheerful moments, troublesome trials, corrections and caresses all go to make-up the feeling of love of father for child. Fathers are needed who love their children by correcting them in love (Heb 12:5-7). Memories of togetherness cement the bond of father and child. And any bumps in the road along the way make up the texture of fabric that warms the relationship.

Being with your father and telling him that you love him and wish you could be together more often is mindful of fathers in the Bible. Fathers need to seek the wisdom of God to guide their families in righteousness. They need to hear their children when they need encouragement and support. Fathers also should have a desire to provide moral examples that will make their children proud. (Prov 31:10-12). Fathers should be leaders of their families both materially and spiritually and bear the sacrifices that come with it. (1 Tim 3:4)

This special day for fathers should reflect the love and respect that children have for their fathers who fully love the Lord and who teach their children to love God (Deut 6:4-9). Fathers are needed who love their children’s mother and by that love show their children how to love their (future) spouses. Actually, faithful fathers deserve honor every day: “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor your father and mothers...that it may be well with you...” (Eph 6:1-2)
